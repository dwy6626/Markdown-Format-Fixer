# Markdown Format Fixer for Exporter
## What is Exporter
- http://falcon.star-lord.me/exporter/
- export your notes in Apple's Notes app (which does not support any way for user to migrate his/her note to other app. Such as [Bear](https://bear.app/) or [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) that support **Markdown**)
- with beautiful GUI, thanks, Chintan Ghate.

## However
The output of Exporter is not perfect. There are some drawbacks, such as:
- \*\*\*\*\*\*
```
this block will be rendered as only one line
but expected to be 2 lines
```

## This script can:
- auto delete for redundant symbels: * or _

- Add line breaks
    - thanks to this [gist](https://gist.github.com/shaunlebron/746476e6e7a4d698b373): a very short note but have got over 100 stars

## This script cannot:

> - Attachments and url-links are not imported correctly.

mentioned in https://apps.apple.com/us/app/exporter/id1099120373.

That is, you still have to do that manually.

I will do that for my notes after I finish this readme.
